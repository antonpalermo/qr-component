## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework

### What I learned

I just learn how to create a react app using [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/), awesome tool. In combination with vanila css to achieved the challange styles. I strugle a bit on how to center the component on the page and the flexbox saved me a good amount of time.

```
.center {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm planning to replace the css with tailwind but I think that's a bit of an overkill for a simple project.
